# Vaader-Database
Home Optimization Project for lowest energy costs. The USP is that we use the isolated house  as a heat battery to minimize energycosts.

What we do here:
- This database has some static tables set up during installation
- The database contains the results of the optimization and parameters and default values when calculations doesn't add up
- Added python scrips is used to set up the static tables
