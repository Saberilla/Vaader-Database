# Vaader-Database
This is part of a home optimization project to achieve the lowest energy costs. The USP is that we use the isolated house as a heat battery to minimize energycosts while heating.

Project Vaader consists of the repos:
- ElProgram2
- ElOptimering
- Database

Please watch the video for more details! >> https://youtu.be/ln52k-g5RTQ?si=epgsfeSTMuHEkCsr

What we do here:
- This database has some static tables set up during installation
- The database contains the results of the optimization and parameters and default values when calculations doesn't add up
- Added python scrips is used to set up the static tables
